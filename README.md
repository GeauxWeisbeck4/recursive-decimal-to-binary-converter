# Recursive Decimal to Binary Converter

A decimal to binary number converter created with the freeCodeCamp.org JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms challenge.

Put in any decimal number and get its binary counterpart returned once you click convert. There's an especially cool little animation for you too when you enter 5 and click convert - you get an animation showing how a recursive program would work in this application!
